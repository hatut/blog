      <description>I can only say that I have seen a lot of this kind of thing. I just want to say that I understand everything and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say much if I don&amp;rsquo;t understand it. Fine details, don&amp;rsquo;t ask the reason.

The rest of me can only say that the water is too deep and involves a lot of things.</description>
